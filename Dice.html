                    <p>The D4 determines damage for the smallest weapons found in Dungeons and Dragons. Its one of the strangest of the dice available because it has several numbers on each side. When rolling a D4, the result is determined by the number that is along the bottom edge of the die. Turning the die, you’ll see the number on all three sides. It will also be the only number that appears right-side up rather than at an angle. You only need to look at one side of the four-sided die to determine the numerical outcome, as that number will be the same of the other two sides.

                    <p>The D6 will be most familiar to people. Its shaped exactly like the dice used for Monopoly, Risk,  Tenzi, Yahtzee and many other games. However, a D6 in Dungeons and Dragons, like all other D&D dice, use traditional numbers rather than the dots that are seen on conventional game-playing dice. Like the others mentioned, the D6 is used for determining the damage done by spells and weapons.

                        <p>Like the D12 and D10, the D8 is used more often than not for determining damage done. It’s used fairly often because it’s the damage factor assigned to weapons that can be wielded in one hand, which means the other hand is free to use a shield. Carrying a sword and shield is popular for the warrior classes, and they tend to gravitate toward weapons that can do the most damage while still allowing the added protection of a shield. Those weapons often do 1 to 8 points of damage and so require the D8.

                        <p>Much like the D12, the D10 is primarily used to determine damage from specific weapons or spells. Additionally, your two D10s can be used when your Dungeon Master determines that something has a percentage chance of succeeding. Usually in a set, the two D10s will be different colors. You will determine what color is the first number and what is the second. Say, for instance, you make the green die first and the blue die second. You roll, and green comes up a 6, and the blue comes up a 4. You just rolled a 64… or a 64%. In the game, you come to a very narrow stone bridge. You are wearing heavy armor, but you decide to try to cross the bridge. Factoring in other aspects of your attributes, the Dungeon Master determines you have a 34% chance of falling off the bridge while crossing. As you begin to cross, you roll. Roll a 34 or above, you safely cross the bridge. Roll 33 or lower, you fall into that raging river below. Other dice rolls and skill sets will determine if you drown or not.

                            <h1>D100</h1>
                            <p>A ten-sided d100 die, often referred to as a percentile die, is a d10 marked in increments of 10 (00, 10, 20, etc.), rather than 1–10. It is used in conjunction with a regular d10 to generate a number between 1 and 100 for percentile-based rolls in Dungeons & Dragons and other RPGs.
                                Rolling the d100
                                To roll a percentile check, you need:
                                    1.	A d100 die (percentile die) – This is a d10 marked with multiples of 10 (00, 10, 20, … 90).
                                    2.	A standard d10 – This is a regular ten-sided die marked from 0–9.
                                Interpreting the Roll
                                    •	The d100 die determines the tens place (00, 10, 20, … 90).
                                    •	The d10 determines the ones place (0–9).
                                    •	Combine the two results to form a number between 1 and 100.
                                Examples:
                                    •	Rolling a 30 (d100) and a 7 (d10) → 37
                                    •	Rolling a 90 (d100) and a 2 (d10) → 92
                                    •	Rolling a 00 (d100) and a 5 (d10) → 5
                                    •	Rolling a 00 (d100) and a 0 (d10) → 100 (not 0!)
                                When to Use Percentile Rolls in D&D
                                Percentile dice are commonly used for:
                                    •	Random Tables – Determining items, encounters, or effects from tables in the Dungeon Master’s Guide or homebrew lists.
                                    •	Wild Magic Surges – Sorcerers with the Wild Magic subclass roll a d100 when triggering a Wild Magic Surge.
                                    •	Miss Chance (Older Editions) – In some editions of D&D, concealment or certain conditions required a percentile roll to determine success.
                                    •	Special Abilities – Some abilities or magical effects rely on percentile chances.
                                Alternative to Using a d100 Die
                                If you don’t have a percentile die, you can use two regular d10s instead:
                                    •	Assign one die as the tens place (e.g., red die = 10s, blue die = 1s).
                                    •	Roll both and interpret the result the same way.
                                This method is functionally identical to rolling a d100 die.

                            <p>The D12 is almost exclusively a die that determines battle damage. You and monsters in Dungeons and Dragons only have so many hit points or “life points”. When the hit points go to zero, you or the monster are dead. If you’re able to hit your enemy as determined by the D20, then you find out how much damage you do. Some of the largest weapons (and some spells) do 1 to 12 points of damage and so are determined by the D12. You roll and get an 8. The orc you were fighting only had 5 hit points left. That orc is dead!

                            <h1>D20</h1>
                            <p>The D20 is essential to D&D gameplay. It is by far the most-used die of them all. In battle, it determines who strikes first and how accurate their strike. For instance, you encounter an evil living tree that blocks your path. You roll a 15 on the D20. The Dungeon Master rolls for the evil tree and gets a 13. They might use a dnd dice roller online, or they might have a couple of dnd dice sets. These dice sets can come include all sorts of awesome dice, including wood dice, or more premium metal sets. It all really depends on how much they want to put into their dice collection. Some folks have collections that include hundreds of dice sets, while others search for something like dice roller 5e and just use online versions. In this case, you have the initiative and strike first. The living tree’s tough bark gives it an armor class of 14. That means, in order to do damage to it, you must roll a 14 or higher on the D20 to do any kind of damage to the tree. Of course, these are simplified explanations, and many other factors come into play. For instance, you might have a magical sword that adds +1 to your attack roll. In this case, you would need to roll a 13 or higher to hit the tree. Once, you’ve hit the opponent, you still need to determine the extent of damage done, which is when the other dice come into play.

                                      You extend your hand and trace a sigil of warding in the air. Until the end of your next turn, you have resistance against bludgeoning,

                                      As part of the action used to cast this spell, you must make a melee attack with a weapon against one creature within the spell's range. 
                                      On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects and becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn. 
                                      If the target willingly moves before then, it takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends. The spell's damage increases when you reach 
                                      higher levels: the initial attack deals an extra 1d8 thunder damage at 5th level, 2d8 at 11th level, and 3d8 at 17th level.

                                      You create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to assail 
                                      it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 necrotic damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start of your 
                                      next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target. If you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls against you 
                                      until the end of your next turn. This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

                                      You create a bonfire on ground that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the bonfire fills a 5-foot cube. Any creature in the bonfire’s space 
                                      when you cast the spell must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into

                                      The spell creates more beams when you reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at 11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct 
                                      the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make a separate attack roll for each beam.

                                      When the spell ends, the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and may become hostile toward you.

                                      and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light.

                                      This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, 
                                      a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, 
                                      leaving no trace of the former damage. This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but it can’t restore 
                                      magic to such an object.

                                    <p><strong>Components:</strong> Verbal, Somatic, Material (a short piece of copper wire)</p>

                                      You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message 
                                      and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target 
                                      and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks 
                                      the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a straight line and can travel around corners or through openings.

                                    <h3>Minor Illusion</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>
                                    <p><strong>Range:</strong> 30 feet</p>
                                    <p><strong>Components:</strong> Somatic, Material (a bit of fleece)</p>
                                    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 minute</p>
                                    <p>
                                      You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. The illusion ends if you dismiss it as an action 
                                      or cast this spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else’s 
                                      voice, a lion’s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. If you create an image of an object, it must be no larger than 
                                      a 5-foot cube. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, as objects pass through it.

                                      You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You can manipulate it in one

                                      <ul>
                                        <li>Excavate it, move it, or shape it.</li>
                                        <li>Cause shapes, colors, or both to appear on the dirt or stone, spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns.</li>
                                        <li>If the dirt or stone is on the ground, you can cause it to become difficult terrain.</li>
                                      </ul>
                                    </p>

                                      You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. 
                                      The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 1d12 poison damage. This spell’s damage increases 
                                      by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

                                      This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice. You create one of the following effects: 
                                      <ul>
                                        <li>Create an instantaneous sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks or a puff of wind.</li>
                                        <li>Light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.</li>
                                        <li>Instantly clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic foot.</li>

                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Produce Flame</h3>
                                    <p><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 action</p>

                                      A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. 
                                      The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast it again.
                                      You can also attack with the flame, though doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame 
                                      at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. This spell’s damage increases 
                                      by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

                                      A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. 
                                      On a hit, it takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. The spell’s damage 
                                      increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

                                      You touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw of its choice. 
                                      It can roll the die before or after making the saving throw. The spell then ends.

                                      Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw 
                                      or take 1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw. The spell’s damage increases 
                                      by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

                                      The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature’s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting 
                                      ability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die

                                      Make a melee spell attack against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d6 piercing damage, 
                                      and if the creature is Large or smaller, you pull it up to 10 feet closer to you. 
                                      This spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).
